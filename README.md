[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/689f6acf-df66-45e1-881f-69778a8570b0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/procurrencypwa/deploys)  

Procurrency is a currency converting PWA built as part of the Andela Learn with Google 3 cohort. I built this web app as part of the graduation criteria for the Mobile Web Development track. It is a pure HTML app with no UI libraries meant to demonstrate profeciency with Service Workers and Progressive Web Application technology. It does not make use of any UI libraries and is written purely in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, like the old days, before jQuery but with less suffering (Thanks ES6+ ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜Œ)  

## Setup  

There is not mu setup neded, the app can be served by any web server capable of handling static files, it is mostly static content with a dependency on the free currency converting API at [free.currencyconverterapi.com](https://free.currencyconverterapi.com). All you need to do is register for an access token and you will be good to go.

## Deployment

Deploy the directory into any web server capcable of serving static files and you're good to go.
